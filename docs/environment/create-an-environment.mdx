# Create an Environment

# MayaOps Environment Creation Documentation

## Overview

An environment in MayaOps represents an isolated workspace where you can deploy and manage your applications and resources. Each environment is associated with a specific AWS account and region, allowing for clear separation of concerns and resource management.

## Step-by-Step Environment Creation Process

### 1. Accessing the Environments Section

- From the MayaOps dashboard, locate and click on the "Environments" option in the main navigation menu
- The Environments page displays existing environments and provides options to create new ones

### 2. Initiating Environment Creation

- Click the "Create Environment" button in the top right corner
- This opens the environment creation wizard

### 3. Selecting AWS Account

- Choose the AWS account where you want to create the environment
- Only connected AWS accounts will be displayed in the dropdown
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions for the selected account

**Key Points:**

- Account must be properly configured with MayaOps
- Required IAM roles and policies must be in place
- Account health status is displayed

### 4. Environment Naming

- Enter a unique name for your environment
- Naming conventions:
  - Must be unique within your organization
  - 4 characters long
  - Can contain only alphabets

**Best Practices:**

- Use descriptive names (e.g., "prod", "sbox", "test", "dev")
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Include team or project identifiers if necessary

### 5. Template Selection

**Available Templates:**

1. **Standard Default Template**
   - Basic VPC setup
   - Public and private subnets
   - Standard security groups
   - NAT Gateway
   - Basic monitoring

### 6. Region Selection

- Choose the AWS region where your environment will be provisioned
- Considerations for region selection:
  1.  **Latency**: Choose regions closer to your users
  2.  **Compliance**: Consider data residency requirements
  3.  **Cost**: Different regions have different pricing
  4.  **Service availability**: Not all AWS services are available in every region

### 7. Environment Creation

- Click the "Create" button to initiate environment provisioning
- The process typically takes 5-10 minutes
- Progress can be monitored in real-time

**Status Indicators:**

```
* Requested
* In Process
* Success
```

### 8. Post-Creation Steps

After successful environment creation:

1. Review the environment details
2. Configure additional settings if needed
3. Set up access controls
4. Configure monitoring and alerts
5. Document the environment specifics

## Best Practices

1. **Planning**

   - Carefully consider region selection
   - Plan IP address ranges
   - Document design decisions

2. **Naming Convention**

   - Use consistent naming patterns
   - Include environment type
   - Consider including team/project identifiers

3. **Security**

   - Review default security groups
   - Configure additional security layers
   - Set up proper access controls

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up basic monitoring
   - Configure alerts
   - Plan for logging
