# AWS VPC Architecture Documentation: Multi-Tier Application with Public-Private Subnet Design

## 1. Architecture Overview

This AWS VPC architecture implements a secure, scalable, and highly available infrastructure design using a multi-tier approach with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). The architecture is specifically designed to host applications that require internet accessibility while maintaining secure internal components.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Entry Points

#### API Gateway
- Serves as the primary entry point for API requests
- Provides API versioning, throttling, and security features
- Enables RESTful API interfaces for the application
- Handles authentication and authorization at the API level

#### Public Load Balancer
- Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances
- Performs health checks on target instances
- Provides SSL/TLS termination
- Enables high availability and fault tolerance

### 2.2 Networking Components

#### Public Subnets
**Purpose**: Host internet-facing resources that need to directly communicate with external clients

**Components**:
- EC2 instances (Web/Application servers)
- NAT Gateways (for enabling private subnet internet access)
- Load Balancers

**Characteristics**:
- Direct route to Internet Gateway
- Public IP addresses available
- Accessible from the internet
- Located in multiple AZs for redundancy

#### Private Subnets
**Purpose**: Host internal resources that should not be directly accessible from the internet

**Components**:
- Amazon RDS instances
- Redis Cache
- Internal application servers
- Database Migration Service (DMS)

**Characteristics**:
- No direct internet access
- Access internet through NAT Gateway
- Enhanced security for sensitive resources
- Spread across multiple AZs

## 3. Communication Flow

### 3.1 Inbound Traffic Flow
1. External requests arrive at API Gateway
2. Requests are forwarded to the Public Load Balancer
3. Load Balancer distributes traffic to EC2 instances in public subnets
4. Public subnet EC2 instances process requests and communicate with private subnet resources as needed

### 3.2 Internal Communication
- Public subnet resources communicate with private subnet resources through internal VPC networking
- Private subnet resources can communicate with each other within the VPC
- Database connections are established only from application servers to RDS instances
- Redis cache is accessed by application servers for improved performance

### 3.3 Outbound Traffic Flow
- Private subnet resources access internet through NAT Gateway in public subnet
- Public subnet resources can directly access internet through Internet Gateway
- All outbound traffic is logged and monitored

## 4. Security Implementation

### 4.1 Network Access Control

#### Network ACLs (NACLs):
- Stateless firewall at subnet level
- Controls inbound and outbound traffic
- Provides additional security layer

#### Security Groups:
- Instance-level firewall
- Stateful traffic control
- Fine-grained access control

### 4.2 Access Patterns
- Public subnet resources: Limited to necessary inbound ports (e.g., 80, 443)
- Private subnet resources: No direct inbound access from internet
- Database access: Restricted to application servers only
- Cache access: Limited to application tier

## 5. Benefits of this Architecture
